[XGrid] - A Flexible Data Grid 
==================================================

The XGrid provides tabular data grid with a flexible/extensible API. 
The main goal of the XGrid is the maintainablility and reuse. So I have focused on the design.

Please see the tests/XGrid/UsageTest.php file to find out how it works.
